1. James Helgren, Levi Jacoby, Lucas Thormann - CS4318
2. We planned to meet everyday once our team was officially formed. We aimed for meeting at 2:00 p.m. everyday & working until we grew tired of working on the assignment for the day.
3. James implemented the Symbol Table. Levi implemented the AST & glued together anything he saw issues with. Lucas implemented the semantic rules. We worked together on the remaining aspects of the project (i.e. error handling, debugging, etc.)
4. The two test cases we included are niceneasy.mC & simple.mC. Both of these files can be found in the /assgn2/test/ directory.
5. All parties contributed equally.
